Hello everyone!

This is C++ Checkers/Draughts played according to the Russian Checkers rules.
The game supports all Checkers fitures including multi-taking (has to be done step by step) and kings. 

However, if you find a bug or something doesn't work properly, don't hesitate to notifying me and doing pull requests.
